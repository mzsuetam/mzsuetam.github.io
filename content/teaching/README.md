# Teaching


This section contains materials related to my teaching and academic involvement at AGH University of Kraków.

Since October, I have been participating in a **student internship at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Automatics, Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering (WEAIiIB)** at AGH University of Kraków. As part of this internship, I am involved in scientific research and have the opportunity to **co-teach Data Engineering classes** for the *Computer Science and Intelligent Systems* program.

The teaching activities are conducted under the supervision of **Sebastian Ernst, PhD**, and allow me to actively engage in the academic process from both the learner’s and instructor’s perspectives. Working with students gives me valuable experience in explaining complex technical concepts clearly and practically, while also deepening my own understanding of data engineering and related topics.

The materials collected here include:
- lecture notes and supporting explanations,
- exercises and examples used during classes,
- selected topics and practical insights developed during teaching.
