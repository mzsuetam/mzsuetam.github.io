# Data Engineering

This directory contains teaching materials developed for the **Data Engineering** course taught within the *Computer Science and Intelligent Systems* program at **AGH University of Kraków**.

The course focuses on **practical aspects of working with real-world data**, covering the full data lifecycle — from acquisition and cleaning to integration, analysis, and visualization. Particular emphasis is placed on **heterogeneous datasets**, including **spatial data**, **time series**, and **log data**, reflecting real challenges faced in modern data-driven systems.

The materials have been prepared and used during laboratory classes and live demonstrations conducted as part of academic teaching activities at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Automatics, Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering (WEAIiIB).
