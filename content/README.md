# Welcome!

This website is a growing workspace where I share my work in computer science — spanning research and teaching materials. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and building reliable systems that connect theory with practice.
<!-- This website is a growing workspace where I share my work in computer science — spanning research, teaching materials, and engineering projects. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and building reliable systems that connect theory with practice. -->

Here you will find:
- [**Research**](#content%2Fresearch%2FREADME.md) notes, experiments, and notebooks exploring modern AI and data-driven methods,
- [**Teaching**](#content%2Fteaching%2FREADME.md) materials developed during my studies, including lecture notes and exercises,
<!-- - [**Projects**](#content%2Fprojects%2FREADME.md) documenting systems I’ve built, from backend infrastructure to machine learning pipelines. -->

Feel free to explore, reuse ideas, and reach out if something sparks your interest.
