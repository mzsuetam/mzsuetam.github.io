# Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, spatial data analysis, and data engineering**, with a particular focus on extracting structured, meaningful information from real-world geographic data.

I am especially interested in problems where machine learning methods meet complex data pipelines — from data acquisition and preprocessing to modeling, evaluation, and practical deployment. Spatial data, with its inherent structure, scale, and uncertainty, provides a rich and challenging domain for this type of research.

## Thesis and Conference Work

My Bachelor’s thesis, **“OSM data augmentation using ML methods,”** focused on developing a system for automatically enriching OpenStreetMap data using aerial imagery and machine learning techniques. This work was conducted under the supervision of **Sebastian Ernst, PhD**, at AGH University of Kraków.

The results of this research were presented at the **6th Polish Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PP-RAI 2025)** in the form of an oral presentation and a poster. Co-authoring and presenting the paper *“Augmentation of Parking Information in OpenStreetMap using Aerial Imagery Analysis”* was an invaluable experience that allowed me to engage with the broader AI research community and receive feedback from fellow researchers.

## Research Themes

My current and ongoing research interests include:
- machine learning for spatial and geospatial data,
- data engineering pipelines for large-scale, heterogeneous datasets,
- remote sensing and aerial imagery analysis,
- practical applications of deep learning in real-world systems,
- bridging theoretical methods with robust engineering solutions.

## Current Work

I am currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in Computer Science and Intelligent Systems**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis**, at AGH University of Kraków. Alongside my studies, I continue to develop research projects that build on my interests in spatial data, AI, and data-driven systems.
